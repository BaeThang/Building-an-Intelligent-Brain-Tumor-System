# Building-an-Intelligent-Brain-Tumor-System
This project focuses on developing an intelligent system for the detection and classification of brain tumors using medical imaging techniques and deep learning models. It leverages MRI modalities (such as FLAIR and T1ce) to train a U-Net-based segmentation model and a CNN classifier to accurately identify tumor types.
